\section{Introduction}

Cryptographic algorithms and protocols are quickly becoming more prevelant,
more special purpose, and more complex. In the face of this reasoning about their
correctness is still not easy, and requires a combination of proof, testing,
and peer review. Many of these essential algorithms are also key to our day to
day lives and we require their implementations to not only be correct, but fast.

The question then becomes how do give cryptographers tools to specify, verify,
test and optimize their algorithms. Ideally we would like to increase the rigor
of our verification and allow for the use of a machine proof checker.

The programming language community has a long history with type theory, a
computational proof theory that allows us to equate programs with proofs,
and types with propositions. Type theory allows one to write down a
specification (a type) satisfy it with a program (a proof) and then execute
the program for a result.
