\section{Future Work}
Our current framework is very bare bones and we would like to pursure a couple
directions in the future:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item hardware compiliation
    \item proof automation
    \item reasoning about complexity
    \item optimization\\
\end{itemize}

I think that providing a tool kit for reasoning about optimization of algorithms
and hardware generation will be the most interesting future directions. The current
language is designed to be amendable to extraction to a hardware specification
in a hardware description language, and the main challenge would just be getting
the extraction implemented and proving correspondence between the high level
algorithm and hardware.

The other direction I see being useful is taking more inspiration from previous
verification efforts and reasoning about the computational complexity of
algorithms and being able to prove equivalence between optimized an unoptimized
algorithmic approaches. This would most likely require a redesign of the core
language in order to support this kind of reasoning.

Constructing a verification framework requires a lot of experimentation and refinement
to find the right tradeoff between complexity and simplicity in order to end
up with a final product that is both ergnomic and expressive.
